      <p>Hi, <span class = "tulasi-pic">I</span> am Tulasi. I am a theoretical computer scientist, with a focus on complexity theory. My research interests include the design and analysis of efficient algorithms for solving computational problems, as well as the study of the fundamental limits of computation. I am also interested in the application of theoretical computer science to other fields such as cryptography and machine learning.</p>
